# John-Wallis-calc-Pi
A C implementation of the John Wallis series for calculating π (pi). This project demonstrates the convergence of π through an infinite series and serves as an educational example of mathematical approximations in programming. 


This repository contains a C program that calculates an approximation of π (pi) using the James Gregory series. The program allows the user to specify the number of terms in the series, providing better accuracy for larger values of NN.

Features

Accepts an integer NN within the range 1000 to 100,000 as input. Calculates π to a high degree of accuracy based on the specified NN. Outputs the value of π with eight decimal places of precision.

How to Use

  Compile the Program Use a C compiler to compile the program. For example, with GCC:

  Run the Program Execute the compiled program:

  Input the Value of NN When prompted, enter a value for NN between 1000 and 100,000. The program will verify the input and ask again if the value is invalid

  View the Result After the calculation, the program will display the approximated value of π:

  Notes

  The higher the value of NN, the more accurate the approximation of π. However, larger values of NN will also increase computation time. Ensure you provide a valid integer input within the specified range.
